# 🏦 Bank-System

A **C++ Bank Management System** built with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Clean Architecture**, simulating real-world banking operations with **role-based access**, **manager approvals**, and **scalable design principles**.

---

## 🌟 Project Vision

To create a **modular, maintainable, and scalable banking system** that mimics real-world banking workflows, prepares for **future GUI, Web API, and Microservices**, and demonstrates **advanced software engineering principles** including **Clean Architecture**, **Design Patterns**, and **iterative development**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Master **OOP Design** and **Clean Architecture** principles.
* Apply **GoF Design Patterns** in practical scenarios.
* Simulate **real-world banking operations** with multiple roles and permissions.
* Build **iteratively** through multiple versions/releases.
* Prepare a **robust, extendable codebase** for future GUI/Web/Microservices upgrades.
* Ensure **security and maintainability** in financial operations.

## 📐 Coding Principles

* **Clean Architecture** – separation of concerns, maintainability, testability.
* **OOP Best Practices** – encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
* **Design Patterns** – Factory, Strategy, Observer, Mediator, Chain of Responsibility where applicable.
* **Modularity** – Each domain (Customer, Account, Transaction, Employee) isolated and extendable.
* **Scalability & Extensibility** – Easy to add features without breaking existing code applying OCP.
